# Carpooling application

Final Project Assignment - Telerik Academy Alpha - Java

## Project Description
The application connects people looking to travel with drivers heading the same way, so they can travel together and share the cost.

Carpooling also creates a unique space, enabling exchanges between people who might have never met otherwise but who come together to share a ride.

--------------------

**Public Part** 


 The public part of the project includes the available trips created by other users with an option to
 sort and filter them, the **user login** and **user registration forms**.

--------------------

**Private Part**
 
**Registered user can:**
 - Change his/her information and upload an avatar image
 - Create a trip as driver
 - Apply for a trip as a passenger. Users that apply for the trip should be approved by the driver (owner of the trip)
 

Тhe user who creates a travel sets the starting and ending points, the departure
time and the number of free seats in his/her car which are mandatory for a trip post. 
The driver also can place optional message or restrictions like “no pets”, “no smoking” and/or “without luggage”.
The driver can approve/decline passengers from the candidates pool.
If a passenger apply for a trip and it is approved by the driver he still may cancel
his participation. The driver can also reject a passenger.
The driver can cancel the trip before the time of departure. He also should mark
his trip as ongoing or complete.
When the trip complete the passengers can leave feedback about the driver as
well as the driver can leave a feedback for every passenger. The driver can also leave a negative feedback if a passenger does not arrive at the set time and place for the starting point and vice versa.
  
  Every user have average rating as a driver and as a passenger.
